Here is a step-by-step project outline for "Data Warehousing & Analysis on SQL: HR Data Analytics" using a proper dataset:

Step 1: Understanding the Project
Objective:

Design a schema and relational data model for HR data.
Insert employee data into the database.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on SQL to analyze attrition patterns.
Key Learnings:

Cardinality
Databases
Schema enforcement
SQL commands (stored procedures, views, CTEs)
Step 2: Setting Up the Environment
Tools:

SQL Server (or any other RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL)
SQL Client (SQL Server Management Studio, DBeaver, etc.)
Step 3: Designing the Schema
Tables to be created:

Employees: Basic information about employees.
Departments: Information about various departments.
Job_Roles: Details about job roles.
Employee_Attrition: Information about employee attrition.
Schema Design:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Job_Roles (
    JobRoleID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    JobRoleName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(100),
    LastName VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentID INT,
    JobRoleID INT,
    DateOfJoining DATE,
    DateOfBirth DATE,
    Gender VARCHAR(10),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (JobRoleID) REFERENCES Job_Roles(JobRoleID)
);

CREATE TABLE Employee_Attrition (
    AttritionID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeID INT,
    AttritionDate DATE,
    AttritionReason VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID)
);
Step 4: Inserting Sample Data
Departments:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Departments (DepartmentID, DepartmentName) VALUES
(1, 'HR'),
(2, 'Engineering'),
(3, 'Sales');
Job Roles:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Job_Roles (JobRoleID, JobRoleName) VALUES
(1, 'Manager'),
(2, 'Engineer'),
(3, 'Sales Executive');
Employees:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID, JobRoleID, DateOfJoining, DateOfBirth, Gender, Salary) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 2, 2, '2020-01-15', '1990-05-10', 'Male', 60000),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 1, 1, '2019-03-22', '1985-07-24', 'Female', 75000),
(3, 'Alice', 'Johnson', 3, 3, '2021-06-10', '1992-11-05', 'Female', 55000);
Employee Attrition:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Employee_Attrition (AttritionID, EmployeeID, AttritionDate, AttritionReason) VALUES
(1, 1, '2023-02-01', 'Personal Reasons'),
(2, 2, '2022-12-15', 'Better Opportunity');
Step 5: Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Understanding Cardinality:

Cardinality refers to the uniqueness of data values contained in a column. In the context of the above tables, each EmployeeID in the Employees table should be unique.
2. Writing SQL Queries:

Query 1: Basic Select Query

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Employees;
Query 2: Joining Tables

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName, jr.JobRoleName
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
JOIN Job_Roles jr ON e.JobRoleID = jr.JobRoleID;
Query 3: Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

sql
Copy code
WITH AttritionDetails AS (
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, ea.AttritionDate, ea.AttritionReason
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN Employee_Attrition ea ON e.EmployeeID = ea.EmployeeID
)
SELECT * FROM AttritionDetails;
Query 4: Using Stored Procedures

sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName, jr.JobRoleName, e.Salary
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    JOIN Job_Roles jr ON e.JobRoleID = jr.JobRoleID;
END;

EXEC GetEmployeeDetails;
Query 5: Creating Views

sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW EmployeeSummary AS
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName, jr.JobRoleName, e.Salary
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
JOIN Job_Roles jr ON e.JobRoleID = jr.JobRoleID;

SELECT * FROM EmployeeSummary;
Step 6: Analyzing Attrition Patterns
Query 6: Analyzing Attrition Rates

sql
Copy code
SELECT d.DepartmentName, COUNT(ea.AttritionID) AS AttritionCount
FROM Departments d
JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
JOIN Employee_Attrition ea ON e.EmployeeID = ea.EmployeeID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
Query 7: Exploring Reasons for Attrition

sql
Copy code
SELECT AttritionReason, COUNT(*) AS Frequency
FROM Employee_Attrition
GROUP BY AttritionReason;
Step 7: Conclusion
Cardinality: Ensure each employee and department entry is unique.
Schema Enforcement: Maintain relationships and integrity through foreign keys.
SQL Commands: Utilize stored procedures, views, and CTEs to streamline data retrieval and analysis.
