Here is a step-by-step project outline for "Data Warehousing & Analysis on SQL: HR Data Analytics" using a proper dataset:

Step 1: Understanding the Project
Objective:
1.Design a schema and relational data model for HR data.
2.Insert employee data into the database.
3.Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on SQL to analyze attrition patterns.

Key Learnings:
Cardinality
Databases
Schema enforcement
SQL commands (stored procedures, views, CTEs)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Step 2: Setting Up the Environment
Tools:
SQL Server (or any other RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL)
SQL Client (SQL Server Management Studio, DBeaver, etc.)
Step 3: Designing the Schema

Tables to be created:
Employees: Basic information about employees.
Departments: Information about various departments.
Job_Roles: Details about job roles.
Employee_Attrition: Information about employee attrition.
Schema Design:

1. Understanding Cardinality:

Cardinality refers to the uniqueness of data values contained in a column. In the context of the above tables, each EmployeeID in the Employees table should be unique.


Cardinality: Ensure each employee and department entry is unique.
Schema Enforcement: Maintain relationships and integrity through foreign keys.
SQL Commands: Utilize stored procedures, views, and CTEs to streamline data retrieval and analysis.
